# myForecast
## What is it?
*myForecast* is a simple weather app that hits the forecast.io (Dark Sky Forecast) API and populates the current conditions and 7 day forecast for the user's current location. User can refresh data by pulling the tableview down. Icons designed by Joel Avery from the Noun Project.

## To Run:
1. The Pods folder was not pushed to the github repository. Please run `pod install` before opening the project.
2. I did not include my API keys. See `Secrets.h` on what keys are necessary and create a file `Secrets.m` and fill it with your own API key.
